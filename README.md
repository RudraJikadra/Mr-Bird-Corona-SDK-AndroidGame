# Mr-Bird-Corona-SDK-AndroidGame
This game idea is the reason why I started game development.
A simple to understand but difficult to master arcade game.
All the code files of lua language with icon images are provided along with the apk file.

### features
Easy to understand lua language.
With Revmob Ad support in the code.
And also with Vungle Video Ads support to grant an extra life if the player looses.

### How to play
Screen is divided into two halfs vertically.
If user taps on the right side of the phone then the bird will get a force upwards and to the right, the same goes for the left side.

A pretty simple game easy to understand the lua language.
